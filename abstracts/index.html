        The availability of a reference genome for a species forever changes
        the breadth and depth of work that can be carried out on that species.
        The Darwin Tree of Life project is aiming to "change biology forever"
        by sequencing the reference genomes for the 70,000 described eukaryotic
        species that can be found in Britain and Ireland. I will present an
        update on the DToL project, which is a collaboration between many
        scientists from many institutes. I will then use Anopheles mosquitoes
        to showcase several large scale projects that have been possible thanks
        to the long term availability of reference genomes.

        Hybrid populations frequently form when previously isolated populations
        spread back into secondary contact. The genomes of hybrid individuals
        are a mosaic of ancestry from the parental populations, which is broken
        into finer pieces over time by recombination. At the same time
        selection may act quickly to resolve hybrid ancestry and remove
        maladaptive hybrid combinations of alleles. In the talk we'll discuss
        how we can resolve the temporal and genomic spatial scale of selection,
        using theory, simulations, and analyses of empirical data.

		The mutations introduced into the ancestors of modern humans from
		interbreeding with Neanderthals have been suggested to contribute an
		unexpected extent to complex human traits. However, testing this
		hypothesis has been challenging due to the idiosyncratic population
		genetic properties of introgressed mutations. We developed rigorous
		methods to assess the contribution of introgressed Neanderthal
		mutations to heritable trait variation and applied these methods to
		235,592 introgressed Neanderthal mutations and 96 distinct phenotypes
		measured in the UK Biobank. Introgressed mutations have a significant
		contribution to trait variation, but the contribution of these
		mutations tends to be significantly depleted relative to modern human
		mutations. Different from previous studies, we find no evidence for
		elevated heritability. Previous work has suggested that significant
		associations in introgressed variants are likely driven by linkage
		with nearby causal modern human variants. We therefore developed a
		customized statistical fine-mapping methodology for introgressed
		mutations that led us to identify 112 regions across 47 phenotypes
		where introgressed mutations are far more certain to have a phenotypic
		effect. Examination of fine mapping mutations reveal their substantial
		impact on genes that are important for the immune system, development,
		and metabolism. Our results provide the first rigorous basis for
		understanding how Neanderthal introgression modulates human complex
		traits.</td>

		Although a huge number of human genetic associations have been
		discovered, genetic predictions overwhelmingly use additive polygenic
		scores (PGS), which ignore interactions between loci. Such
		interactions are expected based on evidence from model organisms but
		human examples are limited, with the vast number of potentially-
		interacting SNPs hampering discovery power.  We developed an approach
		to overcome this lack of power by testing for interactions between a
		SNP and groups of other variants, such as those in the PGS, and
		applied it to 97 quantitative traits in the UK Biobank. We are
		motivated by regulatory networks, where a SNP impacting expression of
		one gene can have downstream effects on many others. Our approach is
		robust to false positives due to nonlinear additive effects or locally
		clustered associations and is initialised by iteratively building a
		PGS accounting for all significant linear signals of association.  We
		find widespread, independent interactions: 483 loci across the genome
		interacting with the PGS of 52 traits. For example, rs3131894 shows no
		direct association with waist circumference but changes the predictive
		power of the PGS for this trait; it is an eQTL for ZFP57, HLA-G and
		HLA-A and associates with coeliac disease risk. Future work will
		determine which biological components these loci modulate. These
		findings offer potential to improve PGS performance using non-linear
		terms and identify determinants of PGS performance variability among
		populations.</td>

		The human genome contains hundreds of thousands of regions exhibiting
		copy number variation (CNV). However, the phenotypic effects of most
		such polymorphisms are unknown because only larger CNVs have been
		ascertainable from SNP-array data generated by large biobanks. We
		developed a computational approach leveraging haplotype-sharing in
		biobank cohorts to more sensitively detect CNVs. Applied to UK
		Biobank, this approach accounted for approximately half of all rare
		gene inactivation events produced by genomic structural variation.
		This CNV call set enabled the most comprehensive analysis to date of
		associations between CNVs and 56 quantitative traits, identifying 269
		independent associations (P &lt; 5 x 10-8) likely to be causally
		driven by CNVs. Putative target genes were identifiable for nearly
		half of the loci, enabling new insights into dosage-sensitivity of
		these genes and implicating several novel gene-trait relationships.
		These results demonstrate the ability of haplotype-informed analysis
		to provide insights into the genetic basis of human complex traits.</td>

		The ancestral recombination graph (ARG) is a structure that describes
		the joint genealogies of sampled DNA sequences along the genome.
		Recent computational methods have made impressive progress towards
		scalably estimating whole-genome genealogies. In addition to inferring
		the ARG, some of these methods can also provide ARGs sampled from a
		defined posterior distribution. Obtaining good samples of ARGs is
		crucial for quantifying statistical uncertainty and for estimating
		population genetic parameters such as effective population size,
		mutation rate, and allele age. Here, we use simulations to benchmark
		the estimates of pairwise coalescence times from three popular ARG
		inference programs: ARGweaver, Relate, and tsinfer+tsdate. We use
		neutral coalescent simulations to 1) compare the true coalescence
		times to the inferred times at each locus; 2) compare the distribution
		of coalescence times across all loci to the expected exponential
		distribution; 3) evaluate whether the sampled coalescence times have
		the properties expected of a valid posterior distribution. We find
		that inferred coalescence times at each locus are more accurate in
		ARGweaver and Relate than in tsinfer+tsdate. However, all three
		methods tend to overestimate small coalescence times and underestimate
		large ones.  Lastly, the posterior distribution of ARGweaver is closer
		to the expected posterior distribution than Relate&#x27;s, but this
		higher accuracy comes at a substantial trade-off in scalability.</td>

		Ancestral Recombination Graphs, or ARGs, have been of deep theoretical
		interest for several decades and are now becoming possible to infer at
		scale. However, terminological confusions abound: the word
		&quot;ARG&quot; is understood to mean different things by different
		people. For example, sometimes it is defined as a stochastic process
		of inheritance (akin to the &quot;coalescent with
		recombination&quot;); alternatively it is sometimes applied to the
		graph structure that results from the inheritance process. We aim to
		clear up this confusion, and following the latter definition, point
		out a distinction between a recombination graph where the nodes are
		*events* of different types, and a more flexible definition where the
		nodes instead represent *genomes* and where the genetic information
		transmitted through the graph is tracked using annotations on edges
		rather than annotations on nodes. We show that this second definition
		allows rapid access to the local trees at each point in the genome,
		and can be used to represent a much wider range of models of
		inheritance, as well as dealing with imperfect knowledge of
		recombination events. We therefore argue that this latter
		representation – which we call a genome-ARG or gARG, and which can be
		stored in the well-characterised &quot;tree sequence&quot; data
		structure – is the best suited for practical analysis and evolutionary
		inference.</td>

		Inference of selection from genome sequencing data is a key challenge
		in population genetics. As genomic data sets grow and inference of
		ancestral recombination graphs steadily improves, it is increasingly
		feasible to test selection from pre-estimated genealogies. This
		potentially enables a considerable advance over classical selection
		inference methods relying on patterns of allele frequencies or linkage
		disequilibrium. Methods have begun to emerge for selection inference
		based on genealogies but they are generally complex and
		computationally intensive. Here we examine a series of simpler tests
		based on a likelihood approach that can be implemented in a few lines
		of code. The tests can be applied separately to individual loci, and
		applied to subtrees as well as full trees. Using known and inferred
		genealogies from simulated data, we find that they perform well in
		comparison to much more computationally intensive methods. We further
		show that our tests using pre-estimated genealogies are a useful tool
		to investigate hitchhiking deleterious alleles that arose during
		recent evolution.</td>

		Recently, two new approaches have transformed our understanding of
		human population history. Firstly, sequencing of ancient genomes gives
		us a snapshot of past genetic variation. We can therefore make
		inferences from observed genetic signatures present before historical
		events such as population bottlenecks and natural selection have
		obscured them from the modern gene pool. Ancient DNA has thus revealed
		what cannot be determined from modern genomes alone. Secondly, the
		development of methods that aim to reconstruct population genealogies
		from genetic variation data. Together with an understanding of how
		evolutionary processes alter genealogies this has allowed inference of
		historical and ongoing processes in real world populations. The latest
		updates in these approaches now allow us to combine the two to infer
		genealogies involving both present-day and ancient individuals. I will
		discuss a new method that uses machine learning and tree sequences
		built from ancient and present-day genomes from Europeans and West
		Asians. The method allows us to infer local ancestry along each sample
		chromosome and subsequently estimate the time since admixture for
		individuals belonging to ancient European groups. We show that our
		inferred admixture ages are a better metric than sample ages alone for
		understanding movements of people across Europe in the past.</td>

		Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have recently offered new
		perspectives to solve inference problems from high dimensional data in
		numerous scientific fields, but it is yet unclear which architectures
		are the most suited to genomic data. Here, we present a new ANN
		architecture integrating attention mechanisms to infer effective
		population size history from genomic data. Built upon our previous
		exchangeable architecture SPIDNA, MixAttSPIDNA adds attention layers
		that allow computing more expressive and complex features from
		combinations of haplotypes. The contribution of each haplotype to the
		features is learned automatically and depends on its content and
		affinity with the other haplotypes. Likewise, we use this mechanism to
		automatically perform a voting scheme that aggregates predictions from
		different genomic regions. This new architecture outperforms
		approximate Bayesian computation and SPIDNA on simulations while
		relying directly on raw genetic data and being invariant to haplotype
		permutation in the input. As a proof-of-concept, we use this
		architecture to infer the effective population size history of 54
		populations from the HGDP dataset (Bergström et al., 2020), and we
		compare our results to smc++ (Terhorst et al., 2017). This application
		highlights the ability of the network to handle data with a varying

		Kinship rules such as descent rules – indicating the group (lineage,
		clan) to which an individual is affiliated – and post-marital
		residence rules – determining the place of living of a couple after
		marriage – vary widely between human populations. In western
		societies, individuals are generally affiliated to the groups of both
		their parents (bilateral descent) and choose where to settle after
		their marriage (neolocality). However, the majority of populations
		display unilineal descent rules, that is, individuals are affiliated
		to the group of their father (patrilineal) or to the group of their
		mother (matrilineal), and are either patrilocal – the wife migrates to
		her husband’s village – or matrilocal – the husband settles in his
		wife’s village. Interestingly, human populations are currently mostly
		patrilineal (~ 40 %) and patrilocal (~ 60 %), but little is known
		about the evolution of these kinship rules in human history. Hence, we
		wonder if this overrepresentation of patrilineality and patrilocality
		always existed  and, if not, when they became dominant in human
		populations. By modelling populations displaying different kinship
		rules, we evaluate the influence of these cultural practices on
		genetic diversity and identify relevant diversity estimators that

		The availability of population genomic data through new sequencing
		technologies gives unprecedented opportunities for estimating
		important evolutionary forces such as genetic drift, selection, and

		handle polymorphisms jointly with sequence divergence across species
		are rare and not easily accessible to empiricists. We implemented
		polymorphism-aware phylogenetic models (PoMos), an alternative
		approach for species tree estimation, in the Bayesian phylogenetic
		software RevBayes. PoMos naturally account for incomplete lineage
		sorting, which is known to cause difficulties for phylogenetic
		inference in species radiations, and scale well with genome-wide data.
		Simultaneously, PoMos can estimate mutation and selection biases. We
		have applied our methods to resolve the complex phylogenetic
		relationships of a young radiation of Chorthippus grasshoppers, based
		on coding sequences. In addition to establishing a well-supported
		species tree, we found a mutation bias favoring AT alleles and
		selection bias promoting the fixation of GC alleles, the latter
		consistent with GC-biased gene conversion. PoMos offer a wide range of
		models to reconstruct phylogenies and can be easily combined with

		Hidden Markov models are useful to reconstruct the coalescent process
		and to infer quantities in population genomics. A well-known family of
		such models are sequentially Markovian coalescents (SMCs), which allow
		for the estimation of population parameters through time using
		discretized coalescent times as hidden states. However, SMCs only
		model a single coalescent event, so they cannot be used for
		investigating speciation events involving more than two species. Here,
		we present a new method, ILSMC, which makes use of incomplete lineage
		sorting (ILS) to extract information about the evolutionary history of
		three species. The hidden states of ILSMC are four-leaved phylogenetic
		trees with discretized coalescent times, and the observed states are
		sites along a four-way genome alignment. Due to the parameterization
		of the model, ILSMC is able to obtain unbiased estimators of ancestral
		effective population sizes, speciation times, recombination rates and
		mutation rates. ILSMC is fully flexible since each discretized time
		interval can be modeled with different parameter values, and it can

		Posterior distributions arising out of coalescent-based models of

		Tumor progression is a somatic evolutionary process in which

		allele frequencies (VAF) can be used to infer relevant biological
		parameters, such as mutation rates, or to distinguish between

		that can estimate mutation rate and demographic history while

		sequencing techniques, mutation calling tools and subsequent filters,
		that are applied to generate current datasets. Our method combines
		coalescence simulations (using msprime) ad deep learning, to estimate

		autosomes. Despite marked differences in gametogenesis, physiologies
		and environments across species, fathers consistently contribute more

		which mutations accrue at equal rates in both sexes during early
		development and at a higher rate in the male germline after sexual
		differentiation, with a conserved paternal-to-maternal ratio across

		Population stratification is a well-studied problem in genome-wide

		reducing significant false positive associations, even subtle biases
		in effect size estimates can accumulate across loci, leading to
		systematic biases in polygenic scores. In turn, these biases in the
		distribution of polygenic scores can lead to false positives in

		theory from population and statistical genetics, together with
		simulations, we show that it is possible to guarantee the unbiasedness

		unbiased. We show that by analyzing GWAS and test panels jointly in a
		unified framework, we can leverage the observed overlap in population
		structure between the two samples so as to protect the GWAS from
		stratification biases along the relevant axis of shared structure.
		More generally, our results have implications beyond tests for

		56,855 individuals, given an estimated mutation rate and a realistic
		demographic model. We then consider the distribution of fitness
		effects (DFE) for de novo LOF mutations identified in individuals with
		severe diseases that impose a heavy realized fitness burden, including
		autism and developmental disorders. As expected, these cohorts show an
		enrichment of deleterious mutations, with the majority of evolutionary
		fitness effects that we estimate to be in excess of 10%.
		Interestingly, however, the study design has a big influence on just
		how deleterious the mutations that are detected end up being; for
		instance, mutations identified in probands in simplex family studies
		of autism are more deleterious on average than those identified in
		multiplex family studies, and mutations identified in female probands
		are more deleterious on average than those identified in males. These

		Population genetic analyses of local ancestry tracts routinely assume
		that the ancestral admixture process is identical for both parents of
		an individual, an assumption that may be invalid when considering
		recent admixture. Here we present Parental Admixture Proportion
		Inference (PAPI), a Bayesian tool for inferring the admixture
		proportions and admixture times for each parent of a single admixed
		individual. PAPI analyzes unphased local ancestry tracts and has two
		components: a binomial model that exploits homozygous ancestry regions
		to infer parental admixture proportions, and a hidden Markov model
		(HMM) that infers admixture times from tract lengths. The HMM accounts
		for unobserved within-ancestry recombination by approximating pedigree
		crossover dynamics, thus enabling inference of parental admixture
		times. In simulations, PAPI&#x27;s admixture proportion estimates
		deviate from the truth by 0.047 on average, outperforming ANCESTOR by
		46%. Moreover, PAPI&#x27;s admixture time estimates were strongly
		correlated with the truth (R=0.76). We ran PAPI on African Americans
		genotypes from the PAGE study (N=5,786) and found strong evidence of
		assortative mating by ancestry proportion: couples&#x27; ancestry
		proportions are closer to each other than expected by chance
		(P&lt;10-6), and are highly correlated (R=0.87). We anticipate that
		PAPI will be useful in studying the population dynamics of admixture
		and will also be of interest to individuals seeking to learn about

		Coalescent processes are widely applied for inferring demographic

		their own function each, and allowing for different sampling points in
		time. We implemented various genealogy-based coalescent processes in

		model that integrates forces such as reversible and biased mutations,

		Interbreeding between previously isolated populations or species is a

		admixture that took place within the last few generations, the

		admixture pedigree  Hence, this paired allelic ancestry information
		can be used to infer the admixture proportions of the parents and to

		of the individual’s parents, respectively, without access to genetic
		data from the parents. The method works with genotypes or genotype
		likelihood data and does not rely on information about the chromosomal
		position. This  makes it appropriate for RADseq  and low depth
		sequencing data and does not require a chromosome-level genome
		assembly. We show how we can infer the admixture pedigrees most likely
		to produce the inferred paired ancestries, and how this can help time
		recent admixture events and distinguish them from more ancient ones.

		Cultural Transmission of Reproductive Success (CTRS) designates a type
		of positive correlation in progeny size between parents and children.
		This process, detected in numerous human and animal populations,
		results from various non-genetic factors such as the transmission of
		social rank or resources correlated with reproductive success.  Here,
		we model and simulate CTRS to study its effect on the evolution of
		genomic diversity through time. We show that it has a double impact on
		population genetics: (1) effective population size decreases when CTRS
		starts, mimicking a population contraction, and increases back to its
		original value when CTRS stops, yielding an expansion-like effect; (2)
		coalescent trees (at the core of most population genetics studies) are
		imbalanced during and shortly after CTRS. Consequently, CTRS impacts
		site frequency spectra (SFS) and creates a strong bias in SFS-based
		demographic inference.  Correctly inferring CTRS from genomic data is
		thus crucial, not only for understanding the cultural history of
		populations but also to reconstruct accurately other processes of
		broad interest. We illustrate how exchangeable convolutional neural
		networks trained on simulated genomes enable the joint estimation of
		CTRS and demographic parameters. Similar to recent findings on the
		intricacy of demography, selection, and gene bias conversion, our
		study highlights the importance of integrating multiple processes,
		including CTRS, when studying evolution from genomic data.</td>

		Polyploidy is an important generator of evolutionary novelty,
		occurring within a single lineage (autopolyploidy) or by hybridization
		between different lineages (allopolyploidy). Historically, these

		chromosome pairing, with autopolyploids pairing among all homologous
		chromosomes and allopolyploids pairing only among chromosomes from the

		distinct lineages may pair and thus alleles may be exchanged between
		subgenomes. Quantitatively inferring demographic history and rates of
		subgenomic exchange within polyploids may shed light on the

		developed diffusion models for genetic variation in polyploids with

		Human ancient DNA (aDNA) studies have surged in recent years,
		revolutionizing the study of the human past. Typically, aDNA is
		preserved poorly, making such data prone to contamination from other
		human DNA. Therefore, it is important to rule out substantial
		contamination before proceeding to downstream analysis. As most aDNA
		samples can only be sequenced to low coverages (&lt;1x average depth),
		computational methods that can robustly estimate contamination in the
		low coverage regime are needed. However, the ultra low-coverage regime
		(0.1x and below) remains a challenging task for existing approaches.
		We present an innovative new method, hapCon, to estimate contamination
		in aDNA for male modern humans. It utilizes a Li&amp;Stephens
		haplotype copying model for haploid X chromosomes, with mismatches
		modeled as genotyping error or contamination. We assessed hapCon on
		simulated and down-sampled empirical aDNA data for samples up to
		45,000 years old and from diverse ancestries. Our results demonstrate
		that hapCon outperforms commonly used tools for estimating
		contamination, with substantially lower variance and narrower
		confidence intervals, especially in the low coverage regime.We found
		that hapCon provides useful contamination estimates for coverages as
		low as 0.1x for SNP capture data (1240k) and 0.02x for whole genome
		sequencing data (WGS), substantially extending the coverage limit of
		previous male X chromosome based contamination estimation methods.</td>

		Genetic relatedness is a central concept in genetics, with this year

		Genome wide association studies (GWAS) provide a powerful, yet simple

		reconciling how selection acts on traits when so many of these traits
		are pleiotropic. Given that genetic variation is a result of small
		effects across the genome, pleiotropy can cause spurious signals of
		selection resulting in biological misinterpretations.  Here, we
		motivate and formalize a Bayesian framework to model the impact of

		distributions that unify linkage disequilibrium regression methods
		with Poisson random field methods and a model for the effect of
		pleiotropy on the relationship between effect on trait and selection
		coefficient, without making an assumptions on the distribution of the

		A series of supervised machine learning methods have recently been

		Despite their much-improved performance over traditional statistical

		be a powerful tool to mitigate the effect of model mis-specification
		on the performance of these methods. We demonstrated that the Deep

		Inference of complex demographic histories requires parameterized

		The open source software GADMA addresses these problems, providing
		automatic demographic inference. It proposes a common interface for
		several simulation engines and provides global optimization of
		parameters based on a genetic algorithm.  The initial version of GADMA
		featured only two simulation engines: ∂a∂i and moments.. Both of these
		engines have been improved since GADMA’s initial release. For example,
		∂a∂i introduced inference of inbreeding coefficients, started to
		support demographic histories involving four and five populations and
		enabled GPU support. GADMA has to keep up with these changes, support
		new engines and further enhance its optimization algorithms.  Here, we
		introduce new features of GADMA2, the second version of GADMA
		software. The new simulation engines include momi2 and momentsLD.
		Optimization based on a genetic algorithm was improved by tuning
		hyperparameters. Moreover, a new flexible interface for specification
		of demographic history parameters enables inference of selection and
		inbreeding coefficients. We provide a full overview of GADMA2

		Previous demographic and genetic studies demonstrated the occurrence

		processes. CTRS affects coalescent tree shapes, making them
		imbalanced. This property was used previously to infer patrilinear and
		matrilinear CTRS from Y chromosome and mtDNA polymorphism data,
		respectively. We aim to extend this methodology to nuclear whole-
		genome data, for which, unlike uniparental data, coalescent trees vary
		across the genome. We first infer these trees from genomic data, and
		compute then their imbalance indices. To this end, we compared through
		simulations the imbalances indices of the true coalescent trees and of
		those inferred by two programs (tsinfer and Relate), in simulated
		populations with various demographic histories and CTRS levels, using
		the forward-in-time simulation program SLiM. We showed that both
		packages infer tree imbalance levels along the genome correctly, with
		better performances for tsinfer. We evaluated then how these inferred
		tree imbalance indices could be used as summary statistics in
		approximate Bayesian computation, to infer CTRS from genomic data. Our

		One of the goals of population genetics is to understand how

		Because evolution acts across time and space, many evolutionary

		isolation by distance, local mate choice, or uneven distribution of
		resources. However, the spatial dimension of evolution is often
		neglected, partly due to the lack of tools designed for building and
		evaluating complex spatial population genetic models. To address this
		issue, we present a framework for simulating spatially-explicit
		genomic data, implemented in a new R package called slendr
		(www.slendr.net) using a tailor-made built-in back end written in
		SLiM, a forward population genetic simulator. This framework allows

		temporal dynamics (i.e., population displacements, expansions, and
		contractions) on real Earth landscapes or abstract, user-defined maps,
		and to specify population splits and gene-flow events, all using a

		traditional, random-mating non-spatial models using an alternative

		A tree sequence is a succinct representation of the genealogical

		based on the first coalescence times of labelled trios, that can be

		With simulated data, we demonstrate that this model is identifiable so

		frequency) and deep learning (protein representations by UniRep).
		Predictions of nucleotide conservation by our genomic annotations were

		conservation, chromatin accessibility, gene expression and Gene
		Ontology enrichment. Importantly, predicted nucleotide conservation
		also improved genomic prediction for grain yield (+5% and +38%

		The site frequency spectrum (&quot;SFS&quot;) is the joint
		distribution of allele frequencies from one or more populations.
		Several important summary statistics are functions of the SFS, which
		is also used for inference on selection and demography. It is
		straightforward to estimate the SFS directly from called genotypes,
		but this is known to bias the SFS when working from low-depth next-
		generation sequencing (&quot;NGS&quot;) data. To address this problem,
		the SFS may be estimated from genotype likelihoods using an
		expectation-maximization (&quot;EM&quot;) algorithm, and this has
		become the standard approach in studies based on low-depth NGS data.
		The standard EM approach requires holding all data in RAM and
		iterating over it dozens of times; this places significant demands on
		computational resources as sample size and number of sites increase,
		to the point where it is often impossible to run without significantly
		downsampling the input data. In addition, the standard SFS EM is prone
		to overfitting in the multidimensional setting.  To address these
		issues, we have developed a new, stochastic &quot;window EM&quot;
		algorithm to estimate the SFS. Briefly, the algorithm optimizes
		smaller blocks of data and averages these over larger windows. Using
		this method, we show that we are able to effectively estimate the SFS
		much faster and with constant, trivial RAM usage. At the same time,
		the window-based method induces regularization to greatly reduce

		Though gene-environment interactions (GxE) are believed to be common

		This is because interaction effects at individual loci are typically

		multiple testing burden. Moreover, when identified, associations at
		individual SNPs are often difficult to interpret functionally. To
		improve these aspects of GxE association studies, we extended the TWAS
		framework to test for GxE effects in an imputed expression-trait
		association model—TxEWAS. TxEWAS first performs a GxE test using DGLM
		(logistic regression) for continuous (binary) traits, then employs a

		of phenotype variance - a thus far underappreciated source of bias in

		Bacteria are our constant companions and our interactions with them

		Epigenetics is known to play a key role in the regulation of adaptive
		and innate immune-system (AIIS) relevant genes that dictate the

		explored. We built a classifier (ConvNet), called EpiNN, that
		leverages genome-wide epigenetic data to detect AIIS-relevant regions.
		We trained EpiNN using ChromHMM data for a handcrafted list of 477
		AIIS genes (AUPRC=0.94) and scanned the human genome for new AIIS
		regions to build a genome-wide annotation of predicted AIIS relevance.
		Regions with predicted relevance &gt;0.5 (N=1964) were enriched for
		immune-related function (GO PANTHER p=7e-21). We used LD-score
		regression coupled with genome-wide association statistics for 176

		(|τ*| p&lt;0.05/176) for 20 out of 26 immune-related traits. These
		effects remained significant after conditioning on 97 functional and

		used to train EpiNN. In a meta-analysis of 64 independent traits,
		immune-related traits and diseases were 3.45x more enriched for

		perform well when tested on AFS generated by the msprime simulator,
		which includes linkage. Importantly, our trained MLPRs provide
		parameter predictions instantaneously from input AFS, with accuracy
		comparable to those inferred by dadi’s likelihood optimization while
		bypassing its computationally intensive evaluation process. We also
		implement an accompanying method for quantifying the uncertainty of
		the point estimates output by the trained regressors, using a scikit-

		The Motacilla wagtails are a classic example of an adaptive radiation
		that has resulted in an enormous diversity in male ornamented plumage

		subspecies across the Northern Hemisphere.  Despite this high
		phenotypic variation, little genetic differentiation is seen between
		subspecies when sampling thousands of genetic loci, which has made the
		evolutionary history of Motacilla wagtails difficult to resolve.
		However, these characteristics provide a potentially powerful model
		system to describe the molecular basis of sexual selection in a

		To understand human prehistory, scientists have utilized many diverse

		Despite decades of research, identifying selective sweeps, the genomic

		because in most population genetic analyses only a single time point
		can be sampled. Recent advancements in sequencing technology,
		including improvements in extracting and sequencing ancient DNA, have
		made repeated samplings possible. With these advances in mind, we
		present Timesweeper, a fast convolutional neural network (CNN)-based
		tool for identifying sweeps in population genomic time series.
		Timesweeper works by first simulating time-series data under a user-
		specified demographic model, training a 1D CNN on said model, and
		inferring which variants in a real dataset were the direct target of a
		completed or ongoing sweep. We show that Timesweeper is powerful under
		multiple demographic and sampling scenarios, works with low-coverage
		ancient DNA, finds selected variants with high resolution, and has
		high tolerance for model misspecification. In sum, we show that more
		accurate inferences of sweeps are possible with genomic time-series,
		as will increasingly be feasible in coming years due to both the
		sequencing of ancient samples and repeated samplings of populations

		length with our approach than just analyzing the focal tree alone,
		potentially giving us more statistical power to identify mutator
		alleles. To verify our approach, we performed a mutator simulation in

		variants that were not identified in standard GWAS or prioritization
		of all AELEs. De novo motif analyses at the prioritized variants
		further identified trait-relevant transcription factors, revealing
		novel regulatory networks at conserved AELEs. In summary, this study
		demonstrates an effective interpretation of GWAS based on sequence-
		conserved regulatory elements and establishes a new resource in
		diverse cell types.</td>

		Over the next decade, more than a million eukaryotic species are
		expected to be fully sequenced. This has the potential to improve our
		understanding of genotype and phenotype crosstalk, gene function and
		interactions, and answer evolutionary questions. Here, we develop a
		machine-learning approach for utilizing phylogenetic profiles across
		1154 eukaryotic species. This method integrates co-evolution across
		eukaryotic clades to predict functional interactions between human
		genes and the context for these interactions. We benchmark our
		approach showing a 14% performance increase (auROC) compared to
		previous methods. Using this approach, we predict functional
		annotations for less studied genes. We focus on DNA repair and verify
		that 9 of the top 50 predicted genes have been identified elsewhere,
		with others previously prioritized by high-throughput screens.
		Overall, our approach enables better annotation of function and
		functional interactions and facilitates the understanding of
		evolutionary processes underlying co-evolution.</td>

		The increasing proportion of variance in human complex traits
		explained by polygenic scores, along with progress in preimplantation
		genetic diagnosis, suggests the possibility of screening embryos for
		continuous traits such as height or for genetic liability to adult
		diseases. However, comprehensive modeling of expected benefits and
		risks is lacking. We model jointly the polygenic risk of multiple
		diseases and traits for multiple embryos, using a multivariate
		Gaussian model for the risk score, together with the liability
		threshold model for diseases. Using this model, we develop numeric
		computations and asymptotic formulas for the expected gains when
		screening for multiple traits simultaneously as a function of the
		genetic variance explained and genetic correlations between traits,
		the number of embryos screened, and the parents&#x27; risk score and
		disease status.  Based on joint works with Shai Carmi, Daniel
		Backenroth, Ehud Karavani, Todd Lencz and others</td>
