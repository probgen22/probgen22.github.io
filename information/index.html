    <h2>Conference information</h2>

    

    <p>This page provides all information required for conference attendees.
    </p>

    <p><b>It is currently under construction and to be finalised</b> </p>

    

    <h3>Venues</h3>
    <p>The conference is hosted at the 
    <a href="https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk">Blavatnik School of Government</a>
    and <a href="https://www.some.ox.ac.uk">Somerville College</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>Talks and poster sessions are held at the Blavatnik. Please 
    see the 
    <a href="https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/contact-us-visitor-information">visitor
        information</a> page for more information.
    </p>

    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Travel links</h3>

    <p> For those arriving from out of town, Somerville College and the
    Blavatnik School of Government are an approximately 10 minute walk from the
    central Oxford bus station, and an approximately 15 minute walk from the
    central Oxford train station. As an alternative to walking, both the bus
    and train stations have taxi stands which can be used to catch a taxi to
    the conference venue. If you want to call for a taxi, popular options are
    001 taxi (01865 240000) or Royal taxi (01865 777333), and both companies
    also have apps. Oxford is not well served by ride-hailing services (e.g.
    Uber). </p>

    <p> For those arriving by plane, Oxford is regularly served by buses to
    Heathrow and Gatwick airport, and the service is called <a
    href="https://www.theairlineoxford.co.uk/">the airline</a>. Travel time is
about 90 minutes to Heathrow and about 2 hours to Gatwick, with the Heathrow
buses generally running more regularly. Buses are generally the preferred
method for getting to the airport from Oxford rather than trains. At the
airport, when you board the bus, the driver will ask you what stop you are
getting off at in Oxford, we recommend choosing the central Oxford bus station,
as it is closest to the venue. </p>
    
    <h3>Accommodation</h3>

    <p>Attendees who have booked accommodation are staying at Somerville
    college, which is located immediately adjacent to the Blavatnik School of
    Government. Check in
    location is at the Porters Lodge, accessed via Woodstock Road (<a

maps street view of entry</a>). 
    </p>    
    
    <p>Please note that those who booked 4 nights of accommodation are checked in from 
    March 27th through March 31st, while those who booked 3 nights of accommodation are 
    checked in from March 28th through March 31st.
    </p>

    <p> Delegates can check-in from <b>2pm</b> on the 27th and from <b>10am</b> 
    on the 28th. We encourage delegates arriving on the 28th to check-in as
    early as possible, as the conference schedule for the rest of the day 
    is quite busy and there may be queues later in the day.
    </p>

    <p>Upon arrival, delegates will be given an envelope which includes a
    welcome sheet with information. This welcome sheet includes check out time,
    which is 10am on the day of departure, by which time delegates need to have
    vacated their room and handed in their keys and access card at the Porters
    Lodge. It further includes information about internet access, which is
    provided by WiFi by "_The Cloud". </p>

    <p> Breakfast will be served for those with accommodation from the Servery
    off the main Dining Hall between 8am â€“ 9am (this is included on the welcome
    sheet). Lunch is not provided, you are free to explore, or we recommend
    Taylor's for an easy sandwich and/or soup which is 50 meters south of
    Somerville College at the intersection of Woodstock Road and Little
    Clarendon street. Dinner is booked for 6pm and will be served from the
    Servery off the main Dining Hall. Rooms don't contain fridges or access to
    kitchens. </p>

    <p> For more information, Somerville College has a FAQ which is available
    <a
    href="https://www.some.ox.ac.uk/conferences-and-bb/discover-oxford/guest-faqs/">here</a>.</p>

    
    <h3>WiFi</h3>

    <p>Eduroam is available at the Blavatnik and should work for 
    most users. For those without Eduroam access, WiFi passwords 
    for the 
    <a href="https://help.it.ox.ac.uk/how-to-connect-to-owl">OWL</a>
    network are available on request at registration.
    </p>


    <h3>Slack</h3>
    <a name="slack"></a>
    <p>The primary hub for organisation is the conference Slack workspace
    <a href="https://probgen22.slack.com">ProbGen22</a>. You should receive
    an invite to this workspace via email in the days before the 
    conference. If you have not received an invite or are having 
    difficulty getting access, please email the organisers 
    at <a href="mailto:probgen22@maillist.ox.ac.uk">probgen22@maillist.ox.ac.uk</a>.
    </p>

    <p>More information on how to best use the Slack workspace will be 
    posted in the coming days.</p>


    <h3>Twitter</h3>
    <a name="twitter"></a>

    <p>Twitter is a great way to discuss and promote research, and we 
    hope that this conference will generate lots of activity.
    Please use the 
    <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ProbGen22">#ProbGen22</a> 
    hashtag so we can all take part in the conversations.</p>

    <p>Our policy is that conference attendees are free to tweet about 
    the talks and posters presented 
    <b>unless otherwise stated by the presenter</b>. Please respect
    the wishes of presenters who do not want the details of their
    research to be publicised on Twitter.</p>

    <h3>Talks</h3>

    <p>Talks are 15 minutes long, with 5 minutes allowed for questions 
    and changeover. Session chairs will be asked to keep strictly
    to schedule, so please do not overrun the alloted time. </p>

    <p>All talks take place at the Blatvatnik, and are streamed online using
    Zoom. Zoom links will be emailed to delegates and provided in the Slack workspace.
    </p>

    <h4>Preparing slides</h4>
    <a name="preparing_slides"></a>
    <p>
    For <b>in-person</b> presentations please prepare your slides for a 16:9 ratio
    screen in <b>PDF</b>, <b>PowerPoint</b> or <b>Keynote</b> format,
    and email them to 
    <a href="mailto:presentations@bsg.ox.ac.uk">presentations@bsg.ox.ac.uk</a>
    by <b>noon</b> on the day of your session. Please include your name and session 
    time in the email.
    </p>

    <p> For <b>online</b> presentations, please use Zoom screen sharing to 
    show your slides. The following guidelines may be helpful to ensure
    this process goes as smoothly as possible:
    </p>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li> Please use a wired network connection where possible. </li>
        <li> Please turn off all apps or programs not required for your presentation.</li>
        <li> To preserve bandwidth, if you are at home please request that 
            other family members are not watching Netflix (or similar).</li>
        <li> Please ensure that your device is connected to mains power.</li>
        <li> If you are in a noisy environment please use a headset.</li>
        <li> Please test sharing your slides from the machine you will be using to 
            ensure that you can see what you need to see on your local screens.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <p> For further help, please ask questions on the <b>#help-creating-slides</b>
    channel in the <a href="information/index.html#slack">Slack</a> workspace.
    </p>

    <h3>Posters</h3>
    <p>Poster sessions will be held virtually on Slack, where each poster is 
    presented in its own
    channel. We encourage authors to be available in the channel during their appointed
    session.
    </p>

    <p>Even numbered poster IDs (as listed on the <a href="abstracts">abstracts</a>
    page) will be presented in the poster session on Monday, and 
    odd numbered IDs on Tuesday.
    </p>

    <p>An in-person poster reception will be held at the Blavatnik 
    in the spacious Inamori Forum. We hope that delegates will bring
    their laptops along to this reception so that we can enjoy the
    best of both in-person and online interactions.
    </p>

    <p>We ask poster presenters to prepare a poster summarising the research
    which can be displayed in their Slack channel. Additionally, 
    presenters may consider preparing a short (~3 minute) video 
    giving an overview of the work which can also be pinned to the channel.
    This 
    is a very effective way of getting your message across to as many people
    as possible.
    </p>

    <p>Examples showing a suggested way of organising the poster channel
     will be added in the coming days.
    </p>

    <h3>Meals</h3>

    <p>
    Breakfast is included for delegates staying at Somerville college.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Lunch is not provided</b>. Because there is no conference activity
    during the mornings, we hope that attendees will take the opportunity to 
    explore Oxford, and to enjoy the many great food options available.
    Please see the <a href="information/index.html#food_and_drink">Food and drink</a> 
    section for more information.
    </p>

    <p>There will be regular tea and coffee breaks through the afternoon talk sessions.</p>

    <p>Dinner is provided at Somerville college for all in-person delegates each 
    evening.
    </p>
